# chatserver
A Real Time Chat App With Golang, Angular 2, And Websockets

Full Disclosure: This is **not** my code. This was a tutorial I followed that can be viewed here: https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2016/12/create-real-time-chat-app-golang-angular-2-websockets/

## **Instructions to build and run chatbox**
#### From chatserver/realtime-chat directory
```shell
$ go run main.go
```
#### From chatserver/src/SocketExample directory
```shell
$ ng serve
```
Pull up another browser and send some chat messages!
